This page explains how to set up Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents and build a basic lifelogging environment using Mnemnk.

## Environment Setup

Let's set up the environment needed to install Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents.

### Installing Build Tools

While Mnemnk App is distributed as a pre-built binary, many agents, including Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents, assume that users have a development environment.

The required tools vary depending on the agent.
For the installation described on this page, you'll need Git and Rust.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

## Installing Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents

[Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents](https://github.com/mnemnk/mnemnk-lifelogging-agents) is a collection of essential agents for using Mnemnk as a lifelogging tool.

- [Mnemnk Application](https://github.com/mnemnk/mnemnk-lifelogging-agents/tree/main/mnemnk-application): Outputs application activity
- [Mnemnk Screen](https://github.com/mnemnk/mnemnk-lifelogging-agents/tree/main/mnemnk-screen): Outputs screen captures

### Download and Build

Clone the repository into the "agents" directory that was created in the Mnemnk Directory you specified during Mnemnk App installation.

```sh
cd {Your Mnemnk Directory}/agents
git clone https://github.com/mnemnk/mnemnk-lifelogging-agents.git
```

Build the executable binaries in the cloned directory.

```sh
cd mnemnk-lifelogging-agents
cargo build --release
```

### Agent Flow

Restart Mnemnk App, and open "Lifelogging" from the Agents menu in the upper right. You'll see that Application and Screen have been added.

Choose Import from the File menu, and a file dialog will appear. Select `logging.json` from the `mnemnk-lifelogging-agents/` directory you cloned earlier.

The agents will be loaded in a stopped state, so press the play button â–¶ at the bottom center to start the agents.

When started, the agents' colors will brighten.

Select "Save" from the File menu to save the flow (it will be saved to `agent_flows/logging.json`).

Click Home at the left end of the navigation bar at the top of the screen, and reload (Ctrl+R). You'll notice that today's date has changed, indicating that data has been saved.

Your activities are now being recorded! ðŸŽ‰

### Setting Up Auto Start

Recording only happens while Mnemnk App is running in the background. To keep recording continuously, it's recommended to turn on "Auto Start" on the Settings page so that Mnemnk App starts when you log in to your operating system. Don't forget to Save and restart Mnemnk App after turning it on.

## Installing Mnemnk Browser Extension

What the author personally finds most useful is the integration with web browsing through the browser. In fact, Mnemnk's development began with this feature.

Using the [Mnemnk Browser Extension](https://github.com/mnemnk/mnemnk-browser-extension), page navigations in the browser are sent to the API agent and can be utilized by Mnemnk App.

To install it:

1. Open the release page and download `mnemnk-X.Y.Z-chrome.zip`.
2. Open Chrome's Manage extensions `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Turn on "Developer mode" in the upper right.
4. Drag and drop the downloaded zip file into the browser.

You can optionally specify the address and token for the API agent from the Settings page, but the default settings are fine. If you change the settings of the API agent, it's good to update them accordingly.

## Summary

In this page, we've covered how to install Mnemnk Lifelogging Agents and the Mnemnk Browser Extension.

As you can see from the fact that even the basic lifelogging function of Mnemnk App is provided as an external program, the information Mnemnk App collects and how it is utilized depends on how you build your agents. You can use Mnemnk as a lifelogging tool as the author envisions, or not.
