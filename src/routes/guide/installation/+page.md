Mnemnk App doesn't open a window just by launching it. You can confirm it's running in the system tray at the bottom right of your desktop.

To open the window, either select "Show" from the menu of the tray icon or double-click the icon created on the desktop.

## Configuring Mnemnk App

When you start Mnemnk for the first time, the Settings page will open. (If it doesn't appear, click the gear âš™ icon)

At a minimum, you need to configure the Mnemnk Directory.

### Mnemnk Directory

Specify an empty directory (folder) as the Mnemnk Directory. The following three directories will be created there:

- agent_flows: Where agent flows are saved
- agents: Place custom agents here
- data: Where the database and screenshots are saved

:::warning
Do not use directories in cloud storage (OneDrive, iCloud, etc.).
In the worst case, database files might get corrupted.
:::

After specifying the directory, you can leave the other settings at their defaults. Click "Save" and close Mnemnk App. When you restart it, the three directories mentioned above will be created in your specified location.

### Auto Start

When enabled, Mnemnk App will automatically start when you login to your system.

### Shortcut Keys

- Global Shortcut: Shortcut to invoke Mnemnk App
- Fullscreen: Toggle full-screen display
- Screenshot Only: Hide information in the daily view. The space key is set by default
- Search: Open the search page

### Thumbnail Width / Height

The size of thumbnails used in the daily page. If only one dimension is specified, the image's aspect ratio will be maintained. If not specified, the default height is 36.

### Day Start Hour

Set what hour should be considered the start of a day on the daily page. The default is 0 (12:00 am). For night owls, the default setting may split late-night work between two days, so it's good to set this according to your bedtime.
