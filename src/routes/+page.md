  - title: Automatic Activity Recording
    description:
      The primary feature of Mnemnk is the combination of lifelogging and a multi-agent system.
      It automatically collects and chronologically organizes application usage history, browser browsing history, screen captures, and more.
      This allows users to review their activities later.

    description:
      While many modern AI assistants operate on a cloud basis and need to send user data to external servers, Mnemnk stores all information locally and processes it with locally operating agents.
      Data will not be sent externally unless the user explicitly uses agents that transmit information externally.

  - title: Agent-Based Extensibility
    description:
      System extensibility is implemented through agents.
      Agents can be developed in various programming languages.
      By combining various agents using a visual flow-based UI, users can build complex systems of interconnected agents without programming knowledge.
