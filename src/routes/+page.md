    description:
      Mnemnk's distinctive feature lies in the combination of lifelogging and a multi-agent system.
      Lifelogging is a technology that automatically records daily activities so they can be reviewed later.
      Mnemnk automatically collects and chronologically organizes application usage history, browser browsing history, screen captures, and more.

    description:
      While many modern AI assistants operate on a cloud basis and need to send user data to external servers, Mnemnk takes a different approach.
      All information collected by Mnemnk is stored locally and processed by locally operating agents.
      Data will not be sent externally unless the user explicitly uses agents that transmit information externally.

  - title: Agent-Based Extensibility
    description:
      Using a visual flow-based UI, users can build complex systems linking multiple agents even without programming knowledge.
      Agents can be developed in various programming languages, and users can customize the system by combining agents according to their needs.
